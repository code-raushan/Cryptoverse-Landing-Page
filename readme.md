<br>

**Hi everyone, I am Raushan Kumar.**

>This project is a landing page of a Crypto trading website built purely in HTML and CSS.

<br>

- This is really a good project to learn building good looking and interactive landing pagesðŸ˜‰. Especially the font and color combination used make it look even better and professionalðŸ˜Ž.

- Key learning are as follows:
    - using background image below a banner
    - aligning background image properly
    - centering all the text


Below is the link and the view of the pageðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
